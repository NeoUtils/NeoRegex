## Build

To build this project, the **JDK 17** and the **Android SDK** are required.
I recommend using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) as the IDE, with the **Android**, **Jetpack Compose** and **Compose Multiplatform** plugins installed.

> [!TIP]
> - You can obtain the **JDK** and **Android SDK** directly from **IntelliJ IDEA**.
> - Use **JBR** (JetBrains Runtime) for better window integration.
> - Use run configurations to get started.

## Acknowledgments

NeoRegex relies on several open-source projects to deliver robust, cross-platform capabilities. We extend our gratitude to the authors and contributors of the following libraries, which are essential to the project:

- [**Compose Multiplatform**](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform): A modern, declarative UI framework from JetBrains for building user interfaces across multiple platforms.
- [**Highlight**](https://github.com/NeoUtils/Highlight): Provides syntax highlighting, making patterns more readable and visually clear.
- [**Multiplatform Settings**](https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings): Simplifies configuration and preference management across different platforms.
- [**dbus-java**](https://github.com/hypfvieh/dbus-java): Enables D-Bus integration on Linux, offering essential interprocess communication features.
