## Build

To build this project, the JDK 17 and the Android SDK are required.
I recommend using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) as the IDE, with the **Android**, **Jetpack Compose** and **Compose Multiplatform** plugins installed.

> [!TIP]
> - You can obtain the **JDK** and **Android SDK** directly from **IntelliJ IDEA**.
> - Use **JBR** (JetBrains Runtime) for better window integration.
> - Use run configurations to get started.

## Acknowledgments

NeoRegex utilizes several open-source libraries that greatly enhance its functionality. We would like to thank the authors and contributors of the following projects for their amazing work:

- [**Highlight**](https://github.com/NeoUtils/Highlight):  This library provides essential syntax highlighting features, making the pattern more readable and visually appealing.
- [**multiplatform-settings**](https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings): A useful library for managing settings across multiple platforms, allowing us to easily persist user preferences.
- [**dbus-java**](https://github.com/hypfvieh/dbus-java): This library enables integration with D-Bus, providing important desktop interprocess communication capabilities for Linux systems.
