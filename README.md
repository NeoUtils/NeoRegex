# NeoRegex

A cross-platform app to validate regular expressions.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Android  | WIP    |
| Desktop  | WIP    |

## Build

To build this project, the JDK (Java Development Kit) and the Android SDK are required. 
I recommend using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) as the IDE, with the **Android**, **Jetpack Compose** and **Compose Multiplatform** plugins installed.

> [!TIP]
>
> - You can get the **JDK** and **Android SDK** directly from **Intellij IDEA**. <br>
> - Use **run configurations** to get started.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **NeoRegex** uses **Jewel** to decorate the window on the **desktop** target, for which the **JetBrains Runtime JDK** is required. Any other JDK will fail.
