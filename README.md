## Build

To build this project, the JDK (Java Development Kit) and the Android SDK are required.
I recommend using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) as the IDE, with the **Android**, **Jetpack
Compose** and **Compose Multiplatform** plugins installed.

> You can get the **JDK** and **Android SDK** directly from **Intellij IDEA**.

Use run configurations to get started. <br>
